Pika Note SPA application written in Vue.js with Fetch API.

## Main purpose

The main purpose for PikaNote is to be a note application for PikaCloud. I use it myself for leaving there notes or some download links, but in a feature generating a permadownload link in PikaCore will also cause creating a note in PikaNote with information about link and the name of resource.

PikaNote has the following features at the moment:
- [x] It is able to create a note and edit to existing note,
- [x] Note are dynamically formatted from MD to visual form,
- [x] It allows clicking links while viewning saved note.

## TODO

PikaNote will be extended by following features:
- User will be allow to create a permalink and place a note in PikaNote,
- Direct links to notes,
- Notes will be sortable by name, keywords contained in content text, date,
- Notes list will be presented as "endless scroll list".
